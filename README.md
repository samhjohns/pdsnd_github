### Project Title
<<<<<<< HEAD
Explore US Bikeshare Data using Python

### What was required
First you will need to have the following 3 files downloaded:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

You will also need to have Python, a text editor (atom), and a terminal application (git bash).

### Description
This project is about manipulating data using python and the terminal in order to more easily view the data you seek. I created an interactive terminal which displays the specific data based on the user inputs. We used bikeshare data from 3 cities which had multiple columns including ride start and end time as well as gender, and date of birth of the user. It was also helpful to look at the most frequent start and end locations and there was a column for each of these too.
